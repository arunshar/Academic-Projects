##  Sentiment Analysis using RNN with LSTMs

### Implemented Recurrent Neural Network using Long-Short Term Dependencies (LSTMs) for classifying the sentiment of the Movie Review as positive or negative. The model was implemented in tensorflow and further tuned with optimal parameters such as batch-size, LSTM units, iterations etc. for better training and testing accuracy.

### Instructions:
### Steps for running main.py

1) Place the idsMatrix, wordList and wordVectors files in appropriate location and change the path in code accordingly.
2) Follow step 2 for placing models folder and change the path of the code accordingly.
3) Seperate model folder contains the pre-trained model of 100,000 iterations.
4) Uncomment the code for training the data.
