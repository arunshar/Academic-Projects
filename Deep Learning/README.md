##  Deep Learning

### Projects cover deep learning modern practices (such as Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTMs) and deep learning research topics (such as Autoencoders and Ristricted Boltzman Machine)

### Instructions:
### 1) Install Tensorflow/Keras and required external libraries
### 2) Can also use pre-train model for hands on experience.
